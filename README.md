Facts
=====
- True O(1)-Scheduling, i.e. zero clock cycles jitter.
- Only a few hardware-dependencies, thus easy portable to other MCUs.
- Low interrupt latency.
- Supports all conformance classes.
- Compact, highly configureable implementation, optimized for determinism.
 

USE-CASES:
==========
- Resource efficient hard-realtime systems in general.
- Automotive ECUs.
- Building automation controllers.
- Sensor- / actuator-near controllers in industrial environments.
